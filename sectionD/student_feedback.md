Handling Student issues.

Firstly I would want to be calm, empathetic and maintain my composure before
I respond to the situation. 

I would then have a rapport with the student and request for a zoom meeting to
discuss the matter and try to analyse and review his/hersolution with both our
screens shared.

I would start with explaining to the student that coding/ software engineering
is a discipline and a science which follows methodical and systematic ways, it
aims for reproducible results and problem solving that is guided by frameworks
and theories or certain ways, many people in the field use more or less same
solutions, like Data structures, algorithms and syntax, unlike humanities, no
one person can claim monopoly over something, what matters is application and
results and understanding why you are doing what you are doing.

Lastly I would then ask the student to forward his/her concerns to the relevant
authorities via: [Custome Success Team](support@hyperiondev.com.)  and to kindly retract whatever they would have
posted on social media.

Should all this fail, I would then reach out to my superiors for further
abbitration.
