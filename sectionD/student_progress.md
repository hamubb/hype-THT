I would do one  on one interviews and understand the needs of each and every student, then encourage peer learning and groups,
making the 5 ahead lead these groups and I will  intervene to lead, also offering the necessary help so that those at risk of failing
get enough support to finish projects and catch up, and put a helpdesk hotline and a chat where anyone can help one with a query.

And offering links like websites with materials and videos and chat relays
